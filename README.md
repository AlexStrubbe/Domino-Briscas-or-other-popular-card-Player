 =============================================

Objective:
----------------------------------------------------
Implement a card game or Domino player using algorithms from the provided resources. Analyze the chosen algorithm against Minimax with or without α-β pruning. Perform algorithm complexity analysis to justify your choice, considering options such as Expectiminimax or Monte Carlo Simulation.

## Methodology:
### Game Selection:

* Choose a card game or Domino variant for implementation.

### Algorithm Selection:

* Select an algorithm from the provided resources to implement the game player.
  
### Minimax Analysis:

* Analyze the chosen algorithm against Minimax with or without α-β pruning.
  
### Complexity Analysis:

* Perform algorithm complexity analysis to justify the chosen approach.
  
### Implementation:

* Implement the game player using the chosen algorithm.
  
### Evaluation:

* Evaluate the performance of the implemented player against Minimax.
  
### Guidelines:

* Avoid selecting Poker due to the complexity of bluffing.
* Justify any deviations from the provided guidelines.
